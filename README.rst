Bridge between the NGSI and OPC UA protocols. This agent allows the
communication with a device that implements an OPC UA server, making possible
to read data and dump it to the Orion Context Broker as well as sending
commands to the device.


**Warning:** this is not the official OPC UA IoT Agent of the FIWARE catalog.
The official can be found here_.
